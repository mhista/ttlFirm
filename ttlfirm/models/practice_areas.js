        Workers’ compensation is designed to provide financial support to employees who suffer work-related injuries or illnesses.`,
      detail2: `In New Jersey, most employers are required to carry workers’ compensation insurance, which should cover medical treatment, wage replacement, and other benefits.

      detail2: ` In New Jersey, thousands of traffic violations are issued every day, ranging from minor infractions to serious offenses like driving under the influence. While it may seem easiest to simply pay the fine and move on, doing so is equivalent to pleading guilty—and even a minor offense can lead to costly consequences, including increased insurance premiums and points on your license.`,

        That’s why we strongly encourage you to consult with a skilled attorney before pleading guilty or paying a fine.`,

      detail4: `Although traffic laws are consistent across New Jersey, the outcome of your case can vary depending on the municipal court where your ticket is handled. Municipal judges often have the discretion to downgrade charges or impose the minimum penalties allowed by law. With the help of an experienced lawyer, you may be able to negotiate a more favorable outcome, such as reduced fines, fewer points on your license, or even a complete dismissal of the charges.`,

      detail5: `At Turuchi Law Firm, we thoroughly review every detail of your case to develop the best strategy for your defense. Whether you’re facing a ticket for speeding, careless driving, running a red light, or a DUI/DWI offense, we work diligently to negotiate with prosecutors, present strong arguments in court, and achieve the best possible resolution.
